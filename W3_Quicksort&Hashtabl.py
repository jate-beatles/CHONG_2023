# Algorithms that use randomness 
def geometric(p):
    count = 0 
    if flip(p):
        return 1 + geometirc(p)
    else: return 1 
# the worst case is the always flipping the coin 
# why randomness: 
# Aveage Case Complexity: expected case 
# 
##Why randomness in Data-structure - Hashtables / Treaps 
#in many case store not random data, introduce the randomness into data constructure.
