###Course 1  - linear regression 

##For the gaussan distributione 
# f(x) - 1/segea(2pi)^1/2 + exp{-(x-u)^2 / (2segma^2)}
## Operation with the vector
###  associative vector: 
#               r + s = s + r   (components add to components)
#               -(s) = - for(s1, s2)  for each components 
#                  
#### Modulus & inner product 
# r = [ri, rj]  s = [si, sj]

############################################################################
### THE LENGTH OF THE VECTOR = THE SIZE OF THE VECTOR 
### THE DOT PRODUCT OF THE VECTOR = THE INNER SCALAR   //// PRJECTION PRODUCTION 
### THE DOT PRODUCT OF THE VECTOR ITSELF THEN ^1/2 get the size 

# the length of the r = (a^2 + b^2)^(1/2)
##### Commutative  r . s = s. r = ri*si + rj * sj
##### Distributive over addition: r .(s+t) = r.s + r.t
##### Associatie over scalar multiplication: r.(as) = a(r.s)  ##a is the multiple scalar number
##### if vector length is the multiply its self

#############################################################################
#### cosince rules  c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(theta)
#                   |r-s|^2 = |r|^2 + |s|^2 - 2|r||s|cos(theta)
# we can use the vector to figure out by using cot product vecto it self then ^1/2 to get the size of the vectors
#
#




#### Linear Algebra 

##          The size for the vector is the square root of hte sum of the ###squares of its compoments

###### a. b= a1*b1 + a2*b2 + .... + an*bn 
### Projection is the S onto R, the shadow length of the projection 
#   
#
#   r.s = |r| * |s| * cos(theta)  >>>> theta is the angle between r and s 
#
#
#   (r.s)/|r| = |s|* cos(theta)   >>> right part is the scalar project 
#
##### Projection:    the sca  (r.e) / |e|^2 
#####  Changing Basis 
#
# change the vector basis using other vector - simply understand process by the angle is 90 degree 
#

####  Basis & Vector the linear independece 
#       b3 != a* b2 + c * b1   there are linear combinations 
#       
#
# Nothing updated  refer to this modules
