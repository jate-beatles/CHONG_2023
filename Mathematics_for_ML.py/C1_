#### Linear Algebra 

##          The size for the vector is the square root of hte sum of the ###squares of its compoments

###### a. b= a1*b1 + a2*b2 + .... + an*bn 
### Projection is the S onto R, the shadow length of the projection 
#   
#
#   r.s = |r| * |s| * cos(theta)  >>>> theta is the angle between r and s 
#
#
#   (r.s)/|r| = |s|* cos(theta)   >>> right part is the scalar project 
#
